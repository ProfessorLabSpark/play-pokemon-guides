## 📝 How to Start a Pokémon Club Application

If you're ready to launch a Pokémon Club through your local library, here’s a step-by-step guide to help you navigate the process.

### ✅ Pre-Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- **A library partner**: Someone with access to the American Library Association (ALA) portal and authority to submit the application.
- **A proposed club structure**: Basic ideas for age range, frequency, and activities (e.g., Learn to Play, casual battles).
- **Community support**: Interest from families, kids, or staff who want to participate or help.
- **Optional support from a certified Professor or Organizer**: While not required for approval, having someone familiar with Play! Pokémon programs can help with mentorship, logistics, and club development.

### 🪜 Application Steps

1. **Review the Pokémon Club announcement**  
   Visit [Pokemon.com](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/pokemon-club-program-combines-learning-and-passion-for-pokemon) to understand the goals and benefits of the program.

2. **Contact your library partner**  
   Share the opportunity and confirm they can access the ALA application portal. Offer to assist with planning and descriptions.

3. **Draft your club description**  
   Include:
   - Target audience (e.g., kids 6–12)
   - Planned activities (e.g., Learn to Play, Reward Passport)
   - Community values (e.g., trauma-informed, inclusive, welcoming)

4. **Submit the application via ALA portal**  
   The librarian will complete the form and submit it on behalf of the library. You may be asked to provide supporting details or feedback.

5. **Confirm submission and await approval**  
   Once submitted, TPCi will review the application. Approval typically results in a welcome kit with materials to support your club.

6. **Celebrate and prepare for launch!**  
   After approval, begin planning your first session, organizing materials, and welcoming your community.
